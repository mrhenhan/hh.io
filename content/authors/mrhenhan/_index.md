I am a data scientist and (data|software) engineer at [All.In Data GmbH](https://www.all-in-data.de/de/) located in beautiful [Mannheim, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannheim). My work and research interests include (deep) reinforcement learning, machine learning, software engineering, and natural language processing where I successfully applied my expertise in academic research as well as in real-world business projects in finance, EPC project management, and large online retail. 

I have a preference for elegantly designed, efficient and minimal systems and do not like overengineered or oversized solutions, which is sometimes the reason for being admonished by my boss Florian for getting lost in details and tinkering too much.
