summary: "Many deep reinforcement learning methods have been established for the development of autonomous AI-agents. This talk introduces deep reinforcement learning as combination of deep learning and reinforcement learning and highlights a selection of noteworthy advancements since Mnih et al. introduced Deep Q-learning."
abstract: "With the successful triumph of deep neural networks in computer vision
and the subsequent breakthroughs in the field of deep Q-learning by Mnih et
al. beginning in 2013, the field of deep reinforcement learning came more and
more into focus and achieved remarkable results in robotics, gaming, health
care, and many other areas of research. This paper reviews recent advances of
large influence in the field of deep reinforcement learning and introduces the
necessary foundations for understanding those advancements."
