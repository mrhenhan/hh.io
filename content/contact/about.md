I am originally from [Heidelberg, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidelberg) and a proud ramblin' wreck from both [Hochschule Mannheim](https://www.english.hs-mannheim.de/the-university.html), where I got a B.Sc. degree in computer science with emphasis on software engineering, secure software development and web enginnering and graduate student of the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/index.php), where I satisfied my 'sciency' needs and focused on the areas of anthropomatics and cognitive systems (AI), computer vision, and the advanced evolutionary, qualitative, and empirical aspects of software engineering amongst others.
