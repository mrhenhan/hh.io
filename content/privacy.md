The webserver saves log data with respect to web page accesses containing accessor IP addresses. IP addresses are solely used for error and bug tracking in case of a system fault and not processed in any other way. 

As we do not provide user accounts and do not make use of tracking cookies, those log files are not personally related to HH.IO visitors.

We do not collect, save or process any other data.
